# Data Science Course
# Module 3 Getting and cleaning Data
# Final Project
# By Ruoyu Xing

# Data obtained from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Purpose of the project: create script run_analysis.R that does the following
# 1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
